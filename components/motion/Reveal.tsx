// Scroll-reveal wrapper, shared by every animated section on the site.
//
// PATTERN (copied from AI Studio's proven implementation, 2026-11-01,
// itself picked from motion.dev, the Motion site): elements fade in
// and rise a small distance as they enter the viewport, and
// interactive elements answer presses with a small scale change.
// Values follow the UI/UX Pro Max "Scroll Reveal" guidance (Subtle
// tier): opacity 0 -> 1, y offset only 12px so it reads as a fade,
// not a slide, 300-400ms, easeOut, list items staggered 0.03s.
//
// SAFETY RULES (both sources agree, and this component enforces them):
// - Transform + opacity ONLY — never width/height, so no layout
//   shift (CLS) and no reflow jank.
// - Reduced motion: users who prefer reduced motion get the final
//   state immediately, with no animation at all.
// - No-JS fallback: `initial` is applied by JavaScript only, so with
//   JavaScript off (or before hydration) the content is fully visible.
